                        The samurai (or bushi) were the warriors of premodern Japan. They later made up the ruling
                        military class which eventually became the highest ranking social caste of the <a

                        </a>(1603-1867). Samurai employed a range of weapons such as bows and arrows, spears and guns,
                        but their main weapon and symbol was the sword.

                        Samurai were supposed to lead their lives according to the ethic code of bushido ("the way of
                        the warrior"). Strongly <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2300.html" target="_blank"

                        stressed concepts such as loyalty to one's master, self-discipline, and respectful, ethical
                        behavior. Many samurai were also drawn to the teachings and practices of Zen Buddhism.

                        History The samurai trace their origins to the Heian Period campaigns to subdue the native
                        Emishi people in the Tohoku Region. Around the same time, warriors were increasingly hired by
                        wealthy landowners that had grown independent of the central government and built armies for
                        their own protection.

                    <p>
                        The two most powerful of these landowning clans, the Minamoto and Taira, eventually challenged
                        the central government and battled each other for supremacy over the entire country. Minamoto
                        Yoritomo emerged victorious and set up a new military government in 1192, led by the shogun or
                        supreme military commander. The samurai would rule over Japan for most of the next 700 years.

                        During the chaotic era of warring states in the 15th and 16th centuries, Japan splintered into
                        dozens of independent states constantly at war with one another. Consequently, warriors were in
                        high demand. It was also the era when ninja, warriors specialized in unconventional warfare,
                        were most active. Many of the famous samurai movies by Kurosawa are set during this time.

                        The country was eventually reunited in the late 1500s, and a rigid social caste system was
                        established during the Edo Period that placed the samurai at the top, followed by the farmers,
                        artisans, and merchants respectively.
